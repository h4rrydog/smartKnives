# Abstract
With   the  backdrop  of   the  rapidly  developing  research  in  Natural  Orifice  Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), analysis of the literature supported the view that inventing new, controlled  tissue  dissection  methods  for  flexible  endoscopic  surgery  may  be  necessary.  The literature also confirmed that white space exists for research into and the development of new cutting tools.

The  strategy  of  “deconstructing  dissection”  proposed  in  this  thesis  may  provide  dissection control  benefits,  which  may  help  address  the  unique  manoeuvring  challenges  for  tissue dissection at flexible endoscopy.  

This assertion was supported by investigating six embodiments of the strategy which provided 
varying  degrees  of  enhanced  tissue  dissection  control.  Seven  additional  concepts  employing the  strategy  which  were  not  prototyped  also  were  offered  as  potential  solutions  that eventually might contribute evidence in defence of the strategy. 

One concept for selective ablation — dye-mediated laser ablation — was explored in-depth by 
theoretical  analysis,  experimentation  and  computation.  The  ablation  process  was  found  to behave   relatively   similar   to   unmediated   laser   ablation,   but   also   to   depend   on   cyclic carbonisation for sustained ablation once the dye had disappeared. 

An Arrhenius model of carbonisation based on the pyrolysis and combustion of wood cellulose 
was used in a tissue ablation model, which produced reasonable results. 

Qualitative  results  from  four  methods  for  dye application  and  speculation  on  three  methods for dye removal complete the framework by which dye-mediated laser ablation might deliver on the promise offered by “deconstructing dissection”. 

Overall, this work provided the “deconstructing dissection” strategic framework for controlled 
cutting schemes and offered plausible evidence that the strategy could work by investigating 
embodiments of the scheme.  

In  particular,  dye-mediated  laser  ablation  can  provide  selective  ablation  of  tissue,  and  a theoretical model for the method of operation was offered. However, some practical hurdles need to be overcome before it can be useful in a clinical setting.
